# MAPPy – Proteomic analysis in Python

MAPPy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing LC-MS/MS LFQ intensity results. It aim to integrate with [anndata][] data type and draws from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) [scanpy][] platform, [scverse][] ecosystem,and the scRNA-seq community.
MAPPy includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, and differential expression testing functions directed to proteomic analysis.
The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with large datasets and enables smooth integration with Python written data science and machine learning tools.
